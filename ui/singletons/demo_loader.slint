            description: "Introducing the RoboVac 2100, featuring a circular screen interface designed for an intuitive user experience remenicent of the robots shape. The home screen displays a circular map of your home with real-time updates of the robot’s position.\n\nCleaning modes such as Auto, Spot, and Edge are located around the screen’s perimeter, allowing you to switch modes with a simple tap. Scheduling cleaning sessions is easy with the circular calendar interface, where you can set times by swiping and tapping on the desired days.\nNotifications for issues like low battery or a full dustbin appear as small icons around the edge, providing more details when tapped.\n\nFor manual control, a joystick-like interface in the center lets you navigate the robot with precision. The settings menu, accessible via a gear icon at the bottom, allows you to adjust preferences such as suction power and cleaning patterns. The circular screen also offers dynamic visual feedback, displaying alerts for obstacles and shading completed cleaning areas to give you a clear overview of the robot’s progress."
